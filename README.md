How does FARFETCH quickly produce an AI model? 

# Host
Jorge Marques (Engineering Lead - Machine Learning) 

# Summary
Creating  Machine  Learning  models  is  not  an  easy  task  but  deploying  scalable  and  geo-
distributed Machine Learning models in production is even more  challenging. In this workshop, we will 
present a hands-on introduction to tools for managing, scaling, and serving your Machine Learning models 
with MLflow & Kubernetes in an E-Commerce platform. 
Description:  This  workshop  is  aimed  at  students  interested  in  areas  such  as Machine  Learning or Data 
Science and would like to have a brief introduction to Machine Learning concepts. 
We will provide to the audience an introduction on how to manage, deploy and serve a Machine Learning 
model in production, the challenges to achieving it and the lessons I have learned during my journey at 
FARFETCH.  We  will  interact  with  the  widely  most  used  tools  in  the  community  like  MLflow  as  model 
storage and Kubernetes as infrastructure. 

Students will learn: 
* How to use a model storage 
* How to manage, serve & scale a Machine Learning model 
* How to bring the power of DevOps to Machine Learning 

We will provide to the participants slides, documentation, and support for a completely pythonic hands-
on session. The documentation for this session will be available soon.
